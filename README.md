    * Clicking on the navigation links, all the links lead to the respective pages.
    

* Social Media Links

    * Clicking on the Social Media icons, each of the links opens the respective Social Media Platform.
    * As the webpage is for a fictive Club, the links open the Social Media Platform, not the Club's page on that platform.
    * As expected, each of the Social Media Platform opens in a new tab.


* Form testing

    * The form on the Sign-up page was tested for functionality.
    * If one of the fields is empty a warning message "Please fill this field" appears when click to submit.
    * If the email field is submitted with a non-email text, a warning message "Please include an '@' in the email address" appears.
    * If correct inputs are submitted, no warning or errors appear.
